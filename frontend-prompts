# First Chat
- Can I give you some code to modify?
- *insert baseline HTML code here*
- Here is some CSS code, could you make a better background using this code as a base? *insert CSS code here*
- There is a weird line at the bottom of the webpage. Can you fix that?
- Sorry, the line was caused by the code you wrote that has the gradient, not the code I originally uploaded. Could you fix the weird line?
- Could you make the fonts more mysterious and mystical?
- Could you change the background color to something darker like indigo or navy blue?
At this point, it wouldn't take any responses, so we went to a different chat
# Second Chat
- Could you change the background of this CSS file to something darker like navy blue or indigo, and please include a gradient? *insert CSS code here*
- Could you make that code copyable?
- Could you also change the all of the text colors to silver?
- Can you please finish that code and also go faster? (ChatGPT was very slow)
- Can you make it so when the user enters an input that the image does a rotation?
Here, we realized ChatGPT only knew our CSS code and not our JavaScript code or our HTML code, so we started a new chat so it could help us with this final task.
# Third Chat
- Take a look at this HTML code *insert HTML code*
- Take a look at this CSS code *insert CSS code*
- Take a look at this JavaScript code *insert JavaScript code*
- For the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I sent, can you make it so when a user inputs something, the image plays an animation?
- After doing the shake, the original bobbing animation stops, can you fix this?
